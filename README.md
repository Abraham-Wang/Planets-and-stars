# Planets-and-stars

 Add short description of project here > 
This project decides whether an object is a planet or a star. Because these are both objects in outer space, sometimes they can get hard to differentiate from far away. This project can be used to quickly decide whether an object is a planet or a star. Because of this discovery, it might be easier to find correlations between planets and stars, discover unknown planets, and learn more about our universe.

## The Algorithm

This project uses a resnet18 model which has been transfer learned so that it can find planets and stars. It uses the image
network to find these objects.
Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here.
