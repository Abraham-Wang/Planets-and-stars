# Planets-and-stars

This project decides whether an object is a planet or a star. Because these are both objects in outer space, sometimes they can get hard to differentiate from far away. This project can be used to quickly decide whether an object is a planet or a star. Because of this discovery, it might be easier to find correlations between planets and stars, discover unknown planets, and learn more about our universe.

## The Algorithm

This project uses a resnet18 model which has been transfer learned so that it can find planets and stars. It uses the image
network to find these objects. Using datasets from kaggle, I trained my resnet18 model using 4 epochs and achieved a stunning accuracy of 99%!
